# Day-17 Number Memory Game

A simple, beginner-friendly Python console game that tests and improves your short-term memory. This is part of my **#90DaysOfCode** challenge.

## üéØ What the Game Does

The game shows you a random number sequence for a few seconds. Your goal is to memorize it and type it back correctly. Every correct answer increases the length of the sequence, making the game progressively harder and more fun.

## üß∞ Concepts Practiced

* **Random numbers** using the `random` module
* **Time delays** with `time.sleep()`
* **Loops & conditionals** to control game flow
* **Screen clearing** for better user experience using the `os` module

## üìù How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Save the file `number_memory_game.py` to your computer.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt in the same directory.
4. Run:

Follow the on-screen instructions to play.

## üìö Example Gameplay

```
Remember this number: 3817
(type it after it disappears)
Your answer: 3817
Correct! Next round...
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How You Can Contribute
